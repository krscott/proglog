# proglog
Inter-operation between log4rs logging and indicatif multi-progress-bar

> **Note**
> There has been an [update](https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif/pull/333) to indicatif that addresses this issue ðŸŽ‰.
> So, this workaround is probably no longer needed for most use cases.

## Background
This library is intended to be a stop-gap to cover the most basic use case while working with
indicatif and log4rs until better support is added to those libraries in the future.

## Example
See [example.rs](src/bin/example.rs).
