# proglog
Inter-operation between log4rs logging and indicatif multi-progress-bar

## Background
This library is intended to be a stop-gap to cover the most basic use case while working with
indicatif and log4rs until better support is added to those libraries in the future.

## Example
See [example.rs](src/bin/example.rs).
